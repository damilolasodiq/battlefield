About the Game
--------------
The Battlefield game is an interesting console game designed to emulate 2 nations at war.
As a player, you have can choose between a multi-player mode or a CPU simulated mode (single player).

When the game starts, each player is given a battle area (N x M matrix) with a representation of Soldiers. There are 3 type of Soldier and the number and type of Soldiers a Player get is based on the current game level

    C - Corporal
    S - Sergeant
    G - General

There are 3 categories of weapons in the game, a Pistol, a Shotgun and a Bazooka. A Soldier can only use weapons according to their ranks.
For example, a Corporal can only use a Pistol, a Sergent can use a Pistol and a Shotgun while a General can use any of the 3 weapons.

For a CPU simulated mode, the computer randomly selects a name from some list of TRANSFORMER names.
For every level, each player is assigned the same number of soldiers, weapons and arsenal.

    6) To launch an attack, you need to specify the position of your Soldier to carry out the attack to also a position in the battle area
    of your opponent where the attack your be carried out. For example, you type 0 1 3 4 to select your Soldier at row 1 col 0 to carry out
    an attack on row 3 col 4 in the opponent's battle area.
    7) For every attack, you can see the effect on the enemies field.
        'X' means your attack hit a position without a Soldier in which case, you don't get a point but your Soldier weapon loses a bullet.
        '!' means your attack hit a Soldier on the enemies field and the Soldier died.

    8) Every Soldier type has a range they can shoot for example, a Corporal cannot shoot as far as a Sergeant and a Sergeant cannot shoot as wide as general
    9) If a Soldier tries to shoot to a point on the enemy's area where his cannot reach, his weapon reduces by a round but there's no effect on the enemies field
    and hence, no point awarded.

How points are calculated
-------------------------

    1)Anytime you attack an opponent's area that does not have a Soldier or you shoot an area that is out of range or you shoot an already blasted area,
    you do not get a point, yet your weapon reduces by a round
    2)Depending on the Weapon used to attack, a point is gained for every successful attack (i.e when your a players soldier is able to hit another player's solder)
    However, an additional point is awarded whenever a junior ranked officer kills a higher ranked officer e.g when your Corporal hits your enemy's General or Sergent
